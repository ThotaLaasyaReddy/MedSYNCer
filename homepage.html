            <h2>Organ Donation Process</h2>
            <p>The organ donation process involves several steps to ensure that organs are ethically and efficiently allocated to those in need:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Registration: Individuals register as organ donors through their state registry or when getting a driver's license.</li>
                <li>Medical Evaluation: When a potential donor is identified, medical professionals evaluate the viability of organs for donation.</li>
                <li>Matching: Available organs are matched with compatible recipients based on medical criteria and urgency.</li>
                <li>Recovery: Organs are surgically removed in a sterile operating room by specialized surgeons.</li>
                <li>Transportation: Organs are quickly transported to the transplant center where the recipient is waiting.</li>
                <li>Transplantation: The recipient undergoes surgery to receive the donated organ.</li>
            </ol>
